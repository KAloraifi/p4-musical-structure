## Project 4: [Musical Structure App](https://github.com/KAloraifi/p4-musical-structure/tree/master/AudioBook)
### The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.
This app is an audiobook player where it displays the list of books. When a book is clicked, the user is taken to "Now Playing" screen for that book.
